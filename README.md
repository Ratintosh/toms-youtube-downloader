Downloads youtube videos as MP3s... what did you expect?

this is actually my first flask app that works and serves a somewhat useful purpose, hooray.

1. set up a virtual environment in the directory:
`python -m venv .`

2. activate virtual environment
`source bin/activate`

3. install requirements.txt
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. export flask app as index
`export FLASK_APP=index`

5. run the program
`flask run`

6. Go to your web browser and put this in the url:
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

you should be all set up! modify index.py to your liking. The static html file is in the templates folder.
